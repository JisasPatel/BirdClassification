# BirdClassification
Project Overview: BirdWatch ü¶ú

Objective:
Build a cool bird identification system capable of recognizing over 500 bird species.

Steps:

Data Dive: Collected a bunch of bird pics, labeled them by species.

Clean-up Crew: Checked for weird or missing pics, fixed them up. Added more variety with some data magic.

Model Magic: Used a fancy model called EfficientNetB0. It's like a bird genius, pre-trained on lots of pics.

Training Time: Taught the model all about birds using our dataset. Fine-tuned it to be a bird pro.

Testing, Testing: Checked how well the model knows its birds using a set it never saw before.

Metrics Party: Used numbers like accuracy, precision, and recall to see if the model's a bird genius or not.

Fine-Tuning Fiesta: Tweaked some settings to make the model even better.

Showtime: Launched an API so anyone can ask the model, "What bird is this?" Birds get identified instantly!

Nice Interface (Optional): Made a fancy website or app where users can upload bird pics and get instant bird wisdom.

Project Wrap: Wrote down how we did everything, shared it with others who want to make bird-friendly tech.

And that's a wrap! BirdWatch - where tech meets feathers. üê¶‚ú®
